# Requirements

## Hardware Requirements
Quacky does not require any specific hardware for compute, main memory (i.e. RAM), disk, network, or I/O. However, to repeat our experiments to the best extent possible, we recommend an Intel i5 or better CPU, as well as 128 GB or more of RAM.

We ran our experiments with
- Intel i5 3.5GHz X4 processor
- 128 GB DDR3 RAM

## Software Requirements
Quacky has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 only. We require
- Linux 4.4.0-198 or higher, 64-bit
- latest version of Git
- latest version of ABC (see `INSTALL.md`)
- Python 3 packages in `requirements.txt` (see `INSTALL.md`)
